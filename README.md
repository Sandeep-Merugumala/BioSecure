**BioSecure** is a secure, web-based Healthcare Management System designed with a **"Security First"** approach. By integrating advanced cryptographic primitives—**AES-256 Encryption**, **RSA Digital Signatures**, and **Hash Chaining**—directly into the application logic, BioSecure ensures that patient medical records remain confidential, their integrity is verifiable, and all system actions are recorded in a tamper-proof audit log.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔒 Security
- **End-to-End Encryption (AES-256):** Sensitive medical records (diagnoses, prescriptions) are encrypted before storage. Even database administrators cannot read the raw data.
- **Digital Signatures (RSA):** Every record is cryptographically signed by the doctor's private key, ensuring **Non-Repudiation** and **Data Integrity**.
- **Tamper-Proof Audit Logs:** A blockchain-inspired hash chain ensures that log entries cannot be modified or deleted without invalidating the entire chain.
- **Secure Authentication:** Robust user authentication using `bcrypt` password hashing.

### 🏥 Functional
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Distinct portals for **Admins**, **Doctors**, and **Patients**.
- **Doctor Portal:** securely create and sign medical records.
- **Patient Portal:** View personal medical history with automatic decryption.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Monitor system integrity and view audit logs.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Templating:** EJS
- **Security:** 
  - `crypto` (Native Node.js module for AES/RSA/SHA)
  - `bcrypt` (Password hashing)

## 📋 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.0.0 or higher)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (v8.0 or higher)

## ⚙️ Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/biosecure.git
    cd biosecure
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory. You can copy the structure below:
    ```env
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
    DB_NAME=ehealth_db
    SESSION_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_for_session
    ```

## 🗄️ Database Setup

1.  **Initialize the Database**
    Log into your MySQL console and run the commands found in `schema.sql`, or import the file directly:
    ```bash
    mysql -u root -p < schema.sql
    ```

2.  **Seed Default Users**
    BioSecure comes with a seeder script to create dummy doctors, patients, and an admin with valid cryptographic keys.
    ```bash
    node seed_users.js
    ```
    > **Note:** This script generates a default password for all users (e.g., `Sandeep0512@` or similar, check `seed_users.js` logs) and populates the database with encrypted records.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env`).

## 📖 Usage Guide

### 1. Login
Access the system using the credentials generated by the seeder script.
- **Default Admin:** `nick.fury@example.com`
- **Default Doctor:** `doctor1@biosecure.com`
- **Default Patient:** `patient1@biosecure.com`

### 2. Dashboard
- **Doctors** can create new medical records. The system automatically signs these records with the doctor's private key.
- **Patients** can view their history. The system decrypts the data on-the-fly for display.
- **Admins** can review the implementation of security features via the Audit Log dashboard.

## 🛡️ Security Implementation Details

This project is a demonstration of how to apply cybersecurity principles in software development:

- **Confidentiality:** Achieved via AES-256-CBC encryption of the `diagnosis` and `prescription` columns.
- **Integrity & Non-Repudiation:** Achieved via RSA-SHA256 digital signatures on record creation. Verification occurs whenever a record is accessed.
- **Accountability:** Achieved via Hash-Chained Audit Logs (`prev_hash + current_data_hash`).
